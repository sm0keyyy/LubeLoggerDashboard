# LubeLogger Dashboard

A native Windows desktop application that serves as an alternative user interface for an existing LubeLogger instance.

## Project Overview

LubeLogger Dashboard is a Windows client application that connects to and utilizes the LubeLogger API to provide a native desktop experience for managing vehicle maintenance records. This application does not replicate LubeLogger's backend logic or primary data storage, but instead serves as an alternative interface to the existing system.

## Key Features (Planned)

- **Vehicle Management**: View, add, edit, and manage your vehicles
- **Maintenance Records**: Track various record types:
  - Odometer readings
  - Service records
  - Repair records
  - Upgrade records
  - Tax records
  - Gas/fuel records
  - Planned maintenance
- **Maintenance Reminders**: Set and receive notifications for upcoming maintenance
- **Reports & Analytics**: Visualize maintenance history and costs
- **Calendar View**: Timeline of all maintenance activities
- **Document Management**: Upload and manage maintenance-related documents
- **System Operations**: Create backups and perform system maintenance
- **Offline Support**: Limited functionality when disconnected from the network

## Technical Details

- **Platform**: Windows 10/11
- **Framework**: .NET 6+ with WPF
- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **API Integration**: Connects to LubeLogger API
  - Demo instance: https://demo.lubelogger.com/api
  - Authentication: Basic Auth (username/password)
- **Local Caching**: SQLite with Entity Framework Core
  - Enables offline functionality
  - Implements synchronization with the API
- **Secure Credential Storage**: Windows DPAPI for secure credential management
