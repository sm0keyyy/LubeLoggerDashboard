# LubeLogger API Guidelines

## API Stability and Versioning Policies

Based on our investigation of the LubeLogger API, we've established the following guidelines for ensuring API stability in our client application:

### Current API Status

- The LubeLogger API currently doesn't use explicit versioning in the URL or headers
- Base URL for demo instance: `https://demo.lubelogger.com/api`
- All endpoints are accessed relative to this base URL (e.g., `/api/whoami`, `/api/vehicles`)

### Versioning Strategy

While the API doesn't currently expose version information, we'll implement the following strategies to ensure our client remains compatible with future API changes:

1. **Client-Side Version Parameter**
   - Store API version in configuration (default: `v1`)
   - Allow version override for testing with newer API versions
   - Prepare for potential future URL-based versioning (e.g., `/api/v2/whoami`)

2. **Feature Detection**
   - Implement capability detection rather than version checking where possible
   - Check for the presence of specific fields or endpoints before using them
   - Gracefully handle missing features with fallbacks

3. **Abstraction Layer**
   - Create service interfaces that abstract API details from ViewModels
   - Implement adapters for different API versions if needed
   - Use dependency injection to swap implementations based on detected API version

### Handling API Changes

1. **Breaking Changes**
   - Implement fallback mechanisms for removed endpoints
   - Add compatibility layers for changed data structures
   - Log and report API compatibility issues

2. **Non-Breaking Changes**
   - Handle additional fields gracefully (ignore unknown properties)
   - Support optional parameters in newer API versions
   - Utilize new features when available but don't depend on them

## Rate Limits and Other Constraints

### Rate Limit Detection

The LubeLogger API may implement rate limiting, though specific headers haven't been observed in our initial testing. Our client will monitor for standard rate limit headers:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Total requests allowed in a time window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in the current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when the rate limit resets
- `Retry-After`: Seconds to wait before retrying when rate limited

### Rate Limit Handling

Our client will implement the following strategies to handle potential rate limits:

1. **Request Throttling**
   - Track remaining requests based on rate limit headers
   - Pause requests when approaching limits
   - Implement queuing for non-critical requests

2. **Backoff Strategy**
   - Use exponential backoff for retry attempts
   - Honor `Retry-After` headers when present
   - Implement jitter to prevent request storms

3. **User Feedback**
   - Notify users when rate limits affect operations
   - Provide estimated wait times for rate-limited operations
   - Prioritize critical operations when near limits

### Other API Constraints

1. **Request Timeouts**
   - Default timeout: 30 seconds (configurable)
   - Implement per-endpoint timeout adjustments
   - Add timeout handling with user feedback

2. **Fault Tolerance**
   - Implement circuit breaker pattern to handle API outages
   - Add retry logic for transient failures
   - Create health check mechanism to monitor API availability

3. **Payload Limitations**
   - Implement chunking for large document uploads
   - Validate request sizes before sending
   - Handle payload size limitations gracefully

## Implementation Details

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

The circuit breaker pattern will be implemented to prevent cascading failures when the API is experiencing issues:

1. **Closed State** (normal operation)
   - All requests pass through to the API
   - Failures are counted

2. **Open State** (API considered unavailable)
   - Requests fail fast without calling the API
   - Triggered after threshold of failures (default: 5)
   - Remains open for reset timeout (default: 1 minute)

3. **Half-Open State** (testing recovery)
   - Allows a single request to test API availability
   - Success transitions to closed state
   - Failure returns to open state

### Retry Strategy

For transient failures, the following retry strategy will be implemented:

1. **Retry Count**: Maximum 3 retries by default
2. **Delay Calculation**: Exponential backoff with jitter
   - Base delay: 1 second
   - Formula: `delay = baseDelay * (2 ^ retryAttempt) * (0.5 + random(0, 0.5))`
3. **Failure Categories**:
   - Retryable: Network errors, 5xx responses, 429 responses
   - Non-retryable: 4xx responses (except 429), validation errors

## Configuration Options

The following configuration options will be available for API stability and rate limiting:

```json
{
  "Api": {
    "BaseUrl": "https://demo.lubelogger.com",
    "Version": "v1",
    "Timeout": 30,
    "RateLimit": {
      "EnableThrottling": true,
      "MaxRetries": 3,
      "BaseRetryDelayMs": 1000
    },
    "CircuitBreaker": {
      "Enabled": true,
      "FailureThreshold": 5,
      "ResetTimeoutMinutes": 1
    }
  }
}
```

## Monitoring and Logging

To help identify and diagnose API issues, the following will be logged:

1. **Request/Response Details**
   - Endpoint called
   - Response status code
   - Response time
   - Rate limit information

2. **Error Information**
   - Full exception details
   - Request that caused the error
   - Retry attempts

3. **Rate Limit Status**
   - Current remaining requests
   - Time until reset
   - Throttling events

## Future Considerations

1. **API Documentation**
   - Request official API documentation from LubeLogger maintainers
   - Update these guidelines based on official documentation
   - Implement OpenAPI/Swagger client generation if specs become available

2. **API Changes Monitoring**
   - Implement automated tests against the API
   - Add monitoring for unexpected API responses
   - Create notification system for API changes
